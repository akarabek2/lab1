  <p>&amp; Introduction: Amina Karabek! </p>
  <p>Hello! My name is Amina Karabek. I am currently a first year ITM major student here at IIT.
  I am looking forward to understanding and learning the process of creating a website, coding, 
  and getting more familiar with using different web developments. Some fun facts about me is that 
  I love watching soccer, specifically the Premier League, and my favorite team is Man United. 
  I love to cook and bake, and recently my favorite dish is Lagman, which is a Kyrgyz cuisine. I
  enjoy watching rom-com movies, and my all time most rewatched film is You've Got Mail with Meg Ryan 
  and Tom Hanks.
